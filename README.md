# react-interactive-paycard

Inspired from a vue project
[vue-interactive-paycard](https://github.com/muhammederdem/vue-interactive-paycard),
I decided to recreate the same on React as a part time fun project. I did some
minor changes on the animations and optimizations on the code.

A fantastic credit card form with smooth and sweet micro-interactions. Includes
number formatting, validation and automatic card type detection. Built with
reactjs and also fully responsive

### Demo

[https://react-interactive-paycard.chintan9.now.sh/](https://react-interactive-paycard.chintan9.now.sh/)

## Libraries used

- [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!
