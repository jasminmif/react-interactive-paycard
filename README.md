# react-interactive-paycard

Inspired from a vue project [vue-interactive-paycard](https://github.com/muhammederdem/vue-interactive-paycard), I decided to recreate the same on React as a part time fun project.
I did some minor changes on the animations and optimizations on the code.

A fantastic credit card form with smooth and sweet micro-interactions. Includes number formatting, validation and automatic card type detection. Built with reactjs and also fully responsive
